Hello, I am **Tobin C. Harding**. I code in the Linux environment. I
like command line interfaces and statically typed languages. When I'm
not coding I like free diving, playing jiu-jitsu, doing yoga, and
eating beef - not necessarily in that order.

I currently work maintaining various libraries within the
https://github.com/rust-bitcoin organisation. Previously I dabbled in
Linux Kernel work, now I only do Bitcoin - I write Rust all day.

For what its worth, I have undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in
computer science and I live on the Central Coast of New South Wales
Australia, and have three children. My favourite thing in life is hold
my breath and swim under the ocean.
