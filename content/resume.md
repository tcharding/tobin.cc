## Outside Experience

Founded the Central Coast Linux Users Group of New South Wales in
February 2014.  Announced the intent prior, at Linux open source
conference, Linux.conf.au.  Lead role in organizing and administering
the group.  Set up a unincorporated association for
governance.  Acquired sponsorship of venue to hold monthly
meetings.  Financially supported the group for the first three years.

Given presentations on software related topics at the Open Source Summit North
America 2017, Central Coast Linux Users Group (multiple) and the Australian
Computer Society (2015).

## Motivation for Writing Code

* Collaborating with others to produce the best possible codebase/project.
* Continually learning and refining skills and technique (the craft).
* How good ‘clean code’ looks on the screen.
* The feeling when an insurmountable problem dissolves.
* Constantly refining.
